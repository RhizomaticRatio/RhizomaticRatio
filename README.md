# Hey, I'm OÄŸulcan!

I'm a master's student in Cognitive Neuroscience and Clinical Neuropsychology at the University of Padova. I'm passionate about neuroimaging, precision medicine, AI applications in radiodiagnostics and prognosis prediction, brain-computer interfaces (BCI), and computational models of the brain. I also love painting and drawing.
